    <strong>Q</strong>: We want to seperate our customers and employees, so we
    store them in different databases. But we would like to have them use the
    same login dialog for our portal. How can I achieve that with Ory Kratos?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: You can deploy Ory Kratos two times, and use the same
    login/registration endpoints. So you define the same login/registration UI
    URLs in both of the Kratos configurations. You may need to tell your
    login/registration UI which Kratos it is supposed to talk to. The instances
    are cheap to deploy and the databases are completely isolated from each
    other. For example you can have something like <code>/login/customer</code>{' '}
    and
    <code>/login/employee</code>.

  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Is the code audited by an independent entity and is
    there a bug bounty program?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: We will do that when the APIs and core are stable. A bug
    bounty program is in the making but not done yet. If you are a security
    researcher and interested in working on Kratos, please reach out to{' '}

    <strong>Q</strong>: What is the correct flow to sanitize the username and
    make sure it satisfies a specific regex (e.g. only alphanumeric characters)?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: In the identity json schema using{' '}
    <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions">
      Regular Expressions
    </a>
    . To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or
    GitHub you write <a href="https://jsonnet.org">jsonnet code</a>.

<Question tags={['kratos', 'registration', 'cors']}>
  #kratos #registration #cors
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Hey guys, I am currently trying to get the Kratos
    registration flow working on a react app that I am creating. I am having
    CORS issues with the completeSelfServiceRegistrationFlowWithPasswordMethod
    call when using the @oryd/kratos-client JS package.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: You are using AJAX to submit the form. This is not
    supported right now. You need to submit a regular HTML form. Do not use
    AJAX. Do not use fetch. Let the user click the submit button and do not do
    anything. AJAX will be better supported starting Kratos v0.6.

<Question tags={['kratos', 'traits', 'feature']}>
  #kratos #traits #feature
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Is the ability to freeze certain identity fields after
    registration anywhere on the roadmap? Also I want read-only or hidden
    user-specific data. Can I use traits for that? Example: Some of our identity
    traits fields may be the subject to identity validation (
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">
      know your customer
    </a>
    ). Once they are validated we do not allow the identity to be edited by the end-user.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Currently traits are visible to the users and also
    editable by them. It makes sense to have read-only and/or hidden traits for
    users, but we can not give an exact timing when this will be available.
    There is an open issue for this feature:

  #kratos #hooks #feature
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Are there plans to provide hooks on
    registration/login/logouts/identity updates?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Yes! See these issues for more information on the
    current progress:{' '}

  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: How can I verify beforehand if a username is available
    during registration?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: You can not right now. It would allow account
    enumeration attacks. See also the
    <a href="https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/security/#account-enumeration">
      section in the documentation
    </a>.

<Question tags={['kratos', 'database', 'migration', 'feature']}>
  #kratos #database #migration #feature
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Do have plans to support user migration scenarios
    similar to auth0 automatic migrations? E.g. configure a callback to the
    legacy system when you cannot find the corresponding user, and store the
    identity on successful legacy system response.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: No plans yet, but migration is an important piece of the
    puzzle. We will focus on importing existing users first. An alternative to
    callback and custom code is fronting the legacy system with Ory Hydra
    (OAuth2/OIDC Server) and then using that as an upstream in Ory Kratos.

<Question tags={['kratos', 'security']}>
  #kratos #security
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Do you have protection or plans for brute force attacks
    i.e. repetitive login attempts? Leaked database scans?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: See the following document:{' '}
    <a href="https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/security#passwords">
      Ory Kratos Security Measures

  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: How do I append a random suffix e.g. a number to OIDC
    usernames if the username returned by a provider is already taken.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: You can use the md5 function built in the{' '}
    <a href="https://jsonnet.org/ref/stdlib.html">jsonnet standart library</a>.
    See the following issue as well:{' '}
    <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/988">

  #kratos #spa
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: I want to implement a single-page-app (SPA). Is this
    possible with Ory Kratos?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Yes, definitely. We do not have an example-app (yet).
    around some page-reloads, as it is not possible to use the API flows in the
    browser. This is important to prevent CSRF attacks. So hopefully you are not
    too strict with your SPA. A sample app is being worked on here:{' '}
